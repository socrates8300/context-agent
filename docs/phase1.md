# Phase 1: Initial Agent Setup and Core Capabilities

This phase focuses on setting up the foundational components of the Context-Aware Coding Assistant Agent, including basic task parsing, context gathering, and execution.

## Tasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Implement Markdown Task Parser**
  - Description: Develop a module to parse markdown task lists into a structured data format (e.g., JSON or Python objects).
  - Context: `trae_agent/cli.py`, `trae_agent/agent/base.py`
  - Focus: Regular expressions, markdown parsing libraries (if applicable), data structure design.
  - Dependencies: None
  - Priority: High

- [ ] **Task 2: Basic Context Gathering Mechanism**
  - Description: Create functions to read specified files and gather their content. Initially, this will be limited to explicit file paths.
  - Context: `trae_agent/tools/edit_tool.py`, `trae_agent/tools/bash_tool.py`
  - Focus: File I/O, error handling for non-existent files.
  - Dependencies: Task 1
  - Priority: High

- [ ] **Task 3: Task Execution Framework**
  - Description: Implement a basic framework to take a structured task, inject gathered context, and simulate execution (e.g., by printing the prompt and context).
  - Context: `trae_agent/agent/trae_agent.py`, `trae_agent/utils/llm_basics.py`
  - Focus: Prompt engineering, command execution simulation.
  - Dependencies: Task 1, Task 2
  - Priority: Medium

- [ ] **Task 4: Integrate with Local AI Model (Ollama)**
  - Description: Connect the execution framework to a local Ollama instance for actual code generation or modification. This involves setting up the Ollama client and making API calls.
  - Context: `trae_agent/utils/ollama_client.py`, `trae_agent/utils/llm_client.py`
  - Focus: Ollama API integration, model interaction, response parsing.
  - Dependencies: Task 3
  - Priority: High

- [ ] **Task 5: Implement Code Application (File Writing)**
  - Description: Develop a mechanism to apply the generated code/changes from the AI model to the codebase, specifically focusing on writing to files.
  - Context: `trae_agent/tools/edit_tool.py`
  - Focus: File writing, ensuring atomic operations, backup mechanisms (optional).
  - Dependencies: Task 4
  - Priority: High

- [ ] **Task 6: Basic Error Handling and Logging**
  - Description: Add basic error handling and logging for context gathering and task execution failures.
  - Context: `trae_agent/utils/cli_console.py`
  - Focus: Exception handling, logging best practices.
  - Dependencies: All previous tasks
  - Priority: Medium
