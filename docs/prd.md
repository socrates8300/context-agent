# Product Requirements Document: Context-Aware Coding Assistant

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** July 8, 2025  
**Author:** Product Team  
**Status:** Draft for Review  

## Executive Summary

The Context-Aware Coding Assistant is an AI-powered development tool that transforms markdown task lists into intelligent, context-rich coding sessions. Built on the TRAE Agent framework, it uses local Ollama models to provide predictive context gathering, automatic dependency resolution, and seamless execution of development workflows while maintaining privacy and code security.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
- **Context Switching Overhead**: Developers spend 23% of their time gathering relevant files, documentation, and context for coding tasks
- **Manual Context Management**: No systematic way to predict and prepare context for upcoming development work
- **Fragmented Workflow**: Task management systems disconnected from actual development execution
- **Privacy Concerns**: Sending proprietary code to external AI services creates security risks
- **Inefficient Prompt Engineering**: Repetitive context gathering and prompt construction for similar tasks

### Target Users
- **Solo Developers**: Independent developers working on multiple projects
- **Small Development Teams**: 2-5 person teams needing coordinated development workflows
- **AI-First Developers**: Developers who heavily integrate AI into their development process
- **Privacy-Conscious Organizations**: Teams requiring local AI inference for proprietary code

## Product Vision

A declarative development environment where developers describe their work in simple markdown task lists, and an intelligent agent system automatically gathers context, predicts needs, and executes complex coding workflows with minimal human intervention.
